## Introduction
This project is designed to discover and analyze trends of various Kickstarter campaigns across multiple fields and disciplines.  The intent is to collect data relevant to:
* the theater market in the United States, specifically plays
* the theater market in Great Britain, specifically musicals

## Recommendations
* placeholder text, budget of $10000 minimum was initial choice for plays in the United States
* Louise should consider launching a campaign for musicals in Great Britain in the future with attempted production costs closer to 2000, as her original budget of 4000 is higher than what is reasonably expected for a pledge.
